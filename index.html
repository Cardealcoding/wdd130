        <p>Hello! My name is Cardeal Felisberto, and I’m from Maputo, Mozambique.
            I was born on February 28, 2002, and I’m proud to be the first child of my
            parents. I completed my secondary education and am currently pursuing a
            certificate in Software Development at Brigham Young University–Idaho
            (BYU-Idaho), USA, through the BYU Pathway program. My focus is on web and
            computer programming, and I have a deep passion for technology and innovation.
            I’m excited to be enrolled in the WDD 130 course, where I’m learning how to
            build engaging and user-friendly websites. I enjoy exploring new technologies,
            working on personal coding projects, and staying up to date with the latest
            trends in web development. My goal is to use these skills to create meaningful
            digital experiences and build a strong portfolio for future opportunities. I
            look forward to collaborating with my classmates and growing as a developer
            throughout this journey.</p>
